# This repository contains the first part of the test task. Testing was carried out according to [These videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FJHNHdDP3VgJJOE9SWdupOpDJtrROtVm)
* ## All bug reports are added to the ISSUE tab - [Click](https://github.com/k2wln/test-task-1/issues)
* ## The complete test report is located in the report.md file - [Click](https://github.com/k2wln/test-task-1/blob/master/report.md)

### Some bugs were skipped and bug reports were not added. This is due to the fact that I am testing blindly, I cannot know for sure whether there should be a certain functionality, whether it was done on purpose or is it a bug. If I could talk to the developers to ask questions about whether it should work this way or not, then more bugs would be added

### **The second part of the test task will be published in a separate repository and provided shortly**
